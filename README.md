# QA Portfolio – Noreen Barrera

Hello! I'm Noreen, an aspiring QA tester currently studying BS in Information Systems.  
This repository is a growing showcase of my manual QA testing work. It includes test cases, bug reports, and documentation based on a real web application I’m developing — **MedPass**, a medical clearance tracking system built with Laravel and Vue.

## Featured Project: MedPass (Medical Clearance Status Management Laravel System)

**MedPass** is an in-progress system designed to help administrators manage patient records and medical test clearance.  
Although the project is still being developed, I’ve applied QA testing principles to the features already in place.

This QA documentation includes:
- Manual test cases for active system components
- Bug reports with descriptions
- Suggestions for UX or functional improvement
